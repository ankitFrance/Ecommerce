Presenting you all a humble effort performed by me in developing a E-Commerce Angular project which serves the features like

- Getting data from API and showing the Trendy products in the homepage.
-A seller account where there is a possibility to update and delete the product entered.
- User can see the product details by clicking on the images.
- Search bar which shows all products and redirects you to the respected page.
